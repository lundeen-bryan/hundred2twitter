## Contributions

If you'd like to contribute, go to the Issues tab and add a new issue. Describe in detail what you'd like to work on and wait for approval before pushing a new feature. I don't want anyone to waste time building a feature if it won't be incorporated into the app.

The general code of conduct is that you may make comments and contributions but that ultimately Bryan Lundeen or one of the admins he appoints will make the final determination of your status as a contributor. Any behavior deemed disrespectful by use of racial or sexist slurs will result in automatic denial of any requests you make until investigation can be conducted and a disposition is reached in the matter.

<br/>

### Testing Needed

There are several tests that I'd like to try out on the app and I welcome anyone who would like to contribute to this effort. DM Bryan on twitter @LundeenBryan

### Project Status

In Development

#### TODO

- Add Twitter API for user login verification
- Add a backend database to store user values
- Make the App more responsive to smaller screensizes
